1. Introduction

 We ﬁrst give some generalities on fluctuation splitting schemes. In particular, we connect them to ﬁnite volume schemes and show why they offer more flexibility.

2. The Fluctuation Splitting Schemes

Uses dual cells

3. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
3 design principles (up-winding, the linear preserving
property, and a monotonicity condition)

9. Conclusions

Less diffusive than MUSL
stencil more compact
