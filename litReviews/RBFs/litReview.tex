\section*{For interpolations}

\item \bibentry{PTK11} \ \\
Nice description of why a load of different interpolation methods don't work
\item \bibentry{FLF11}

\item\bibentry{FP07} \ \\ How to avoid ill conditioning as RBF becomes increasingly flat

\end{itemize}

\section*{For solving PDEs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{SDY08} \ \\ mesh-free. Compact support. Multi-quadric (since they have exponential convergence) with user-defined shape parameter. Nothing on conservation or monotonicity

\item\bibentry{Cha04} \ \\ Nothing on boundedness, monotonicity or conservation.\\ Collocation better than multi-quadrics

\item\bibentry{WGZ+13} \ \\
RBFs used for calculating the tangential component of the wind from 4 surrounding normal components (neighbouring triangle edges). Inverse multi-quadric kernel $\psi(r)=1/\sqrt{1+(\varepsilon r)^2}$ with shape parameter $\varepsilon=2$. See \cite{BIM11} for details

\item\bibentry{BIM11} \ \\
Use multiquadric with $\varepsilon=1$. So how do you non-dimensionalise $r$? This is where the shape parameter comes in.\\
Smoother results than RT0 on triangles

\end{itemize}

\section*{For advecion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item\bibentry{FW07} \ \\ RBS as a spectral method (ie global support). But cubic convergence

\item \bibentry{FP08} \ \\ Global and compact support (Wendland)

\item \bibentry{BI02} \ \\ Not conservative

\item \bibentry{BCB03} \ \\ Compare local and global RBF and FD. Mesh and mesh-free\\
Wendland functions are strictly positive definite and can be constructed to have any desired amount of smoothness. Wendland functions are the most popular compactly supported RBFs. \\
(Global) thin plate spline RBF does not introduce artificial diffusion or dispersion errors. Compact RBFs do not do so well. \\
Nothing on conservation, boundedness or monotonicity

\item\bibentry{ZDC00} \ \\
Global RBFs. Thin plate spline (TPS) chosen since as accurate as the multiquadrics without needing to compute a shape parameter. However TPS uses $\log(r)$ and so you need to non-dimensionalise $r$ before you take a log. This is where the shape parameter would come in?

\item\bibentry{ZPC98} \ \\
Multiquadric is $C^\infty$ continuous while the thin plate spline (TPS) is $C^{2m-1}$ where $m$ is the order of the TPS. So for higher-order PD operators, need a high order TPS. For heat equation use $m=2$.
