\title{Literature review relevant for moving meshes proposal}

So I think that this could somehow be related to how I might choose the under-relaxation factor?

\item \bibentry{LV10} \ \\
I'm afraid that I am unable to understand this paper or see the relevance to my work

\item \bibentry{FOS1x} \ \\
I niaive discretistation of the Hessian leads to a non-monotone scheme because of the off-diagonal terms of the determinant. A quadratic equation is descretised which has 2 solutions, the 2-convex solution and the negative of this. These become mixed which leads to the instability. No mechanism to pick the right solution. Instead, rotate the coordinate system so that the Hessian is diagonal.

Stencils are very wide - 27, 99 and 291 points

Monotone scheme is less accurate.

Method 2: use the fact that, in 2D,
$|H(u)| = \frac{1}{2}(\Delta u)^2 - \frac{u_{xx}^2+u_{yy}^2}{2}-u_{xy}^2$. Solve the Poission equation implicitly with fixed point iterations to solve Monge-Amp\'ere.

Hilary: Given this, can we put more of the Hessian into the Laplacian?

many of the newly proposed methods converge only for solutions which are in $\mathbf{H}^2(\Omega)$, which is more regularity than is generally
available for solutions of the equation.

Require $u$ (the dependent variable) is convex, required the the MA eqn to be elliptic.

The equation is fully nonlinear, so weak solutions must be interpreted using
either geometric solutions or viscosity solutions.

equation is not in divergence form, so there is no natural weak interpretation

The weak solutions of the equation can be quite singular. Specifically, they
are not in $\mathbf{H}^2(\Omega)$. In fact, they may be only Lipschitz continuous

monotone methods for this equation requires the use of wide stencils, which come with an additional consistency error related to the directional resolution of the stencil

Feng and Neilan [13, 14], solve second order equations (including MA) by adding a small multiple of the bilaplacian.

Lots of examples but not clear if examples are defined in this paper or elsewhere

\item\bibentry{Obe08}

Prove that wide stencil FD solution converges to solution of MA without any regularity requirement.

Convex functions satisfy $\lambda_-\ge0$, and concave functions satisfy $\lambda_+\le0$ in the viscosity sense [17].

Monotonicity, along with consistency and stability is sufficient for convergence of finite difference schemes to the unique viscosity solution of a nonlinear, possibly degenerate elliptic PDE.

Decreasing grid spacing in mesoscale models to less than 10â€“15 km generally
improves the realism of the results but does not necessarily significantly improve the objectively scored accuracy of the forecasts.

more realistic mesoscale structures and evolutions as grid spacing decreases into the single digits (km)

transitioning from 36- to 12-km grid spacing allows the definition of the major mesoscale topographic features of the region and their corresponding atmospheric circulations, producing a beneficial effect on the verifications.
