\section*{Convection Related}

\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{SRLV19} \ \\
From the abstract: \\
``The ability of three parametrizations—the traditional K-gradient model
of Cuxart et al. (CBR), the Smagorinsky formulation, and the Moeng approach
(MOENG) based on the horizontal gradients of the resolved variables -- to reproduce
the thermodynamical and dynamical fluxes was assessed in an offline configuration via a comparison with the reference fields. MOENG was the most appropriate
scheme to represent the vertical and horizontal heat fluxes at all grid spacings in the
clouds and their environment over the entire cloud life cycle, including the appropriate representation of countergradient areas.''

CBW uses TKE as a prognostic then has algebraic expressions for turbulent momentum, heat and moisture fluxes as a function of TKE and mean gradients. 

Smagorinsky just uses mean gradients

``mixing length of Bougeault and Lacarrere (1989),
which is equivalent to the distance a parcel of air with an initial kinetic energy $e(z)$ given by its altitude can travel before
it is stopped by buoyancy effects.'' An algebraic equation.

``Moeng (2014) parametrized the turbulent fluxes based on
products of the horizontal gradients of the resolved variables.''

``Abdella and McFarlane (1997, henceforth AM97)
have proposed a second-order turbulence closure
scheme for the planetary boundary layer. The scheme
contains a prognostic equation for the turbulence kinetic
energy and algebraic expressions for the other second-
order moments. The expressions for the potential temperature flux and the temperature variance incorporate
nonlocal eddy diffusivity and countergradient terms.
These expressions are derived through the use of an
advanced parameterization of the third-order moments
based on convective mass-flux arguments. Remarkably,
the AM97 parameterizations for the flux of potential
temperature flux, $\overline{w^{\prime 2}\theta^\prime}$, and the flux of potential temperature variance, $\overline{w^\prime \theta^{\prime 2}}$, do not have a traditional downgradient diffusion form.''
...
doesn't contain the necessary symmetry.
We ``develop a parameterization that
possesses necessary physical properties and verify it
against large-eddy simulation (LES) and observational
data.''

\item \bibentry{MGM+00} \ \\
``The pressure transport term in the turbulence kinetic‐energy budget becomes more important as the rotation rate increases, whereas the contribution of the third‐order transport term is reduced. All terms in the buoyancy variance budget grow in amplitude as the rotation rate increases. The mean‐gradient term and the turbulent transport term are both gains that are offset by a loss to dissipation in the bulk of the CBL.''

\item \bibentry{Miro01} \ \\
``the relative importance of
the buoyancy contribution to the pressure-gradient-potential-temperature covariance decreases with increasing
rotation rate.'' \\
``the Coriolis contribution becomes more important as the rotation rate increases.'' \\
``underestimation of the pressure term in the flux budget equation and may lead to an erroneous prediction of the
vertical potential-temperature flux in convection with rotation. ''

\item \bibentry{UBH03} \ \\
Compared with $k-\varepsilon$ and M-Y. \\
``$k-\omega$ model computes correct decay rates for turbulent quantities under breaking waves'' \\
requires ``buoyancy term in the second equation is appropriately weighted''\\
Suggestion to buoyancy affected and rotating flows.

Buoyancy production term in $k$ equation is $G=-\nu_t ^\theta N^2$.

\[
\dot{\omega} = \mathscr{D}_\omega + \frac{\omega}{k}
\bigl(
    c_{\omega 1} P + c_{\omega 3} G - c_{\omega 2}\frac{f_{c\omega}}{f_{c\mu}} \varepsilon

\]
$c_{\varepsilon 3} = c_{\omega 3} + 1$

``The master length scale equation we use is quite empirical'' \\
``we believe the equation we use is much to be preferred relative to the transport equation for dissipation'' \\
Level 4 model has prognostic equations for Reynolds stress, turbulent heat transport and theta variance. \\
$q^2$ is 2 TKE \\
Level 3 model, scale ``all terms in the model equations as a product of $q*3/\Gamma$ and powers of $\mathbf{a}$'' where $\Gamma$ is a length scale and $\mathbf{a}$ is a measure of anisotropy. \\
$\varepsilon=q^3/\Gamma_1$ \\

Level 2.5 neglect the material derivative and diffusion terms in prognostic equations for temperature variance. \\
Level 2 ``neglects all material derivatives and diffusion terms''

Prognostic equation for $q^2 \ell$ given.

Level 2.5 recommended: solutions of equations for $q^2$ and $q^2 \ell$. \\
Equation for $q^2 \ell$ performs better than algebraic expression for $\ell$ in level 2 model.

flows. These economical approaches all work adequately when diffusion is of little
importance in the overall second-moment budget.''

``A realizable $k-\varepsilon$ turbulence model of incompressible fluid is extended for the stable atmosphere after taking account of the buoyancy damping of gravity waves. The new model is consistent with the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory on the stable atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over a horizontally uniform surface. The model is incorporated into an ABL model to simulate mean flow against observations. Its ABL-model output is compared with the Leipzig dataset, showing the turbulence model works well for a stable ABL. Specifically, the ABL model properly replicates\\ 1) the mixing length, turbulent viscosity, and mean wind;\\
2) a significant decrease of the mixing length with height in the upper ABL and thus a reasonable altitude of the ABL top; and \\
3) a sensitivity of the mixing length and turbulent viscosity to atmospheric stability.''
