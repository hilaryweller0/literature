Abstract:A series of idealised numerical simulations of dense water flowing down a broad uniform slope are presented, employing both a z-coordinate model (the MIT general circulation model) and an isopycnal coordinate model (the Hallberg Isopycnal Model). Calculations are carried out at several different horizontal and vertical resolutions, and for a range of physical parameters. A subset of calculations are carried out at very high resolution using the non-hydrostatic variant of the MITgcm. In all calculations dense water descends the slope while entraining and mixing with ambient fluid. The dependence of entrainment, mixing and down-slope descent on resolution and vertical coordinate are assessed. At very coarse resolutions the z-coordinate model generates excessive spurious mixing, and dense water has difficulty descending the slope. However, at intermediate resolutions the mixing in the z-coordinate model is less than found in the high-resolution non-hydrostatic simulations, and dense water descends further down the slope. Isopycnal calculations show less resolution dependence, although entrainment and mixing are both reduced slightly at coarser resolution. At intermediate resolutions the z-coordinate and isopycnal models produce similar levels of mixing and entrainment. These results provide a benchmark against which future developments in overflow entrainment parameterizations in both z-coordinate and isopycnal models may be compared. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
